"""
1. Create a list from the elements of a range from 1200 to 2000 with steps of 130, 
using list comprehension.
2 .Use list comprehension to construct a new list but add 6 to each item.
3. Using list comprehension, construct a list from the squares of each element in the list, if the square is greater than 50.
4. Create a dictionary from the list with same key:value pairs, such as: {"key": "key"}.
5. First, create a range from 100 to 160 with steps of 10.
Second, using dict comprehension, create a dictionary where each number in the range is the key and each item divided by 100 is the value.
